---

## 📝 Quick Start Guide

1. **Wire It Up:** Assemble the circuit as shown above.
2. **Upload the Code:** Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
3. **Install Libraries:**
   - `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit
   - `Adafruit Unified Sensor`
   - *(WiFi is built-in with ESP32)*
4. **Configure:**
   - Enter your WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak API key in the code.
5. **Flash ESP32:** Upload the code and power your device.
6. **Visualize Data:** Log in to ThingSpeak and watch your real-time weather dashboard!

---

## ☁️ Setting Up ThingSpeak

1. [Sign up for ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com).
2. Create a new channel for your weather data.
3. Note your **Write API Key** and **Channel ID**.
4. Insert your API key into the Arduino sketch.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The **ESP32** reads temperature and humidity from the **DHT11 sensor** at regular intervals.
- Sensor data is transmitted via WiFi to the **ThingSpeak** cloud in real time.
- View and analyze your weather data anywhere, anytime via live charts on your ThingSpeak dashboard.

---

## ✏️ Customization Tips

- Change the data reading interval in the code for more/less frequent updates.
- Use different GPIO pins if needed.
- Expand your station: Add more sensors (rain, pressure, air quality) for advanced analytics.
